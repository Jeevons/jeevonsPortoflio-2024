######################## 🚀 A Vision for the Future ########################

My Journey:  
I've always had my eyes on the stars, yet my grounding remains here on Earth 🌍. I deeply believe that the technologies we create today will shape and revolutionize the world of tomorrow. My journey into web and mobile development serves as my gateway into the digital universe, but it is merely a stepping stone on the path I aim to walk.

Beyond development, my ambition lies in delving into the fields of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. Once I earn my application developer diploma, my goal is clear: to become an AI engineer and contribute to research, designing solutions that go beyond mere code and actively propel technological evolution.

🌐 Technological Exploration  
Front-end development is my starting point, and while I find great value in it, I see my future within infrastructures and data. Accessibility, ergonomics, and efficiency are fundamental principles I aim to integrate into all my future projects.

By developing my programming skills, combined with my versatility and curiosity, I strive to explore every facet of the web. Whether using tools like After Effects, Illustrator, Blender, or Unity, I seek to merge performance and intuition in my creations.

🌍 Making Innovation Accessible to Everyone  
We live in an era where innovation is advancing rapidly, yet it remains out of reach for many. My ultimate dream is to change this reality. It begins with my commitment to accessibility. I aspire to dedicate my life to making innovation, especially in AI and computer science, available to a broader audience.

💡 By combining my programming expertise with an ever-forward-looking vision, I aim to create tools and solutions that democratize these technologies, making them accessible to all.  

I am not content to merely follow the current; I want to make it more inclusive, more open, and more beneficial to society as a whole.

The future is already part of our daily lives, and I want to be one of those who shape it!
